                   Certificates: Building in Privacy},
  year =          {2000},
  abstract =      {From the Publisher:As paper-based communication and
                   transaction mechanisms are replaced by automated
                   ones, traditional forms of security such as
                   photographs and handwritten signatures are becoming
                   outdated. Most security experts believe that digital
                   certificates offer the best technology for
                   safeguarding electronic communications. They are
                   already widely used for authenticating and encrypting
                   email and software, and eventually will be built into
                   any device or piece of software that must be able to
                   communicate securely. There is a serious problem,
                   however, with this unavoidable trend: unless drastic
                   measures are taken, everyone will be forced to
                   communicate via what will be the most pervasive
                   electronic surveillance tool ever built. There will
                   also be abundant opportunity for misuse of digital
                   certificates by hackers, unscrupulous employees,
                   government agencies, financial institutions,
                   insurance companies, and so on. In this book Stefan
                   Brands proposes cryptographic building blocks for the
                   design of digital certificates that preserve privacy
                   without sacrificing security. Such certificates
                   function in much the same way as cinema tickets or
                   subway tokens: anyone can establish their validity
                   and the data they specify, but no more than that.
                   Furthermore, different actions by the same person
                   cannot be linked. Certificate holders have control
                   over what information is disclosed, and to whom.
                   Subsets of the proposed cryptographic building blocks
                   can be used in combination, allowing a cookbook
                   approach to the design of public key infrastructures.
                   Potential applications include electronic cash,
                   electronic postage, digital rights management,
                   pseudonyms for online chat rooms, health care
                   information storage, electronic voting, and even
                   electronic gambling.},
